# S-P-500-Price-Prediction-Using-Machine-Learning
This project focuses on predicting the S&amp;P 500 index values using historical data from the past 10 years. The goal was to experiment with two popular regression algorithms — Linear Regression and Random Forest Regressor — and analyze their performance on the given dataset.
1. Linear Regression
A simple yet effective baseline model that assumes a linear relationship between features and the target variable.
2. Random Forest Regressor
An ensemble model based on decision trees, designed to capture complex, non-linear relationships in data.

⚙️ Workflow
Data Preprocessing
Cleaned and filtered S&P 500 data.
Split dataset into training and testing sets using an 80-20 ratio.
Key Takeaways
Simpler models can outperform complex ones when data is limited.
Model selection should depend on both data quality and quantity, not just algorithm complexity.
Increasing the dataset size or performing hyperparameter tuning on Random Forest could potentially improve its performance.
Technologies Used
Python
Pandas, NumPy for data manipulation
Scikit-learn for model implementation and evaluation
