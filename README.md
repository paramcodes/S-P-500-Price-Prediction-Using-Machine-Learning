# S-P-500-Price-Prediction-Using-Machine-Learning
This project focuses on predicting the S&amp;P 500 index values using historical data from the past 10 years. The goal was to experiment with two popular regression algorithms — Linear Regression and Random Forest Regressor — and analyze their performance on the given dataset.
1. Linear Regression
A simple yet effective baseline model that assumes a linear relationship between features and the target variable.
2. Random Forest Regressor
An ensemble model based on decision trees, designed to capture complex, non-linear relationships in data.
⚙️ Workflow
Data Preprocessing
Cleaned and filtered S&P 500 data.
Split dataset into training and testing sets using an 80-20 ratio.
Feature Engineering
Created relevant input features (e.g., moving averages, returns, etc.).
Model Training
Trained both models on the same training dataset.
Evaluation Metric
Used Mean Squared Error (MSE) to measure prediction accuracy.
